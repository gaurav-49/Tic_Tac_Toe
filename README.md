# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a simple game. Given two players (‘X’ and ‘O’) taking alternating turns on 
a 3x3 grid, which player can be the first to claim three squares on a single row, column, or diagonal?

As far as games go, tic-tac-toe isn’t terribly interesting. With perfect play, it always ends in a draw.
Furthermore, there are only 26,830 unique games, so the search space is small enough that it can be solved without resorting to deep learning techniques.
